# Config 9 Fixes Applied

## Problem Identified
Current training was failing (stuck at ~50% accuracy) while Config 9 achieved 83.57%. 

## Root Cause
Wrong training parameters compared to successful Config 9:

| Parameter | Current (FAILING) | Config 9 (SUCCESS) | Fix Applied |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Learning Rate | 1e-4 | **1e-3** | ✅ Updated configs.py |
| Weight Decay | 1.3e-6 | **1e-4** | ✅ Updated configs.py |
| Batch Size | 8 | **32** | ✅ Updated configs.json |
| Patience | 10 | **15** | ✅ Updated configs.json |
| Shuffle | false | **true** | ✅ Updated configs.json |
| Residual Connections | Yes | **No** | ✅ Removed from balanced_training_config.py |
| Gradient Clipping | 1.0 | **None** | ✅ Disabled in step.py |

## Test Results
Exact Config 9 replica achieved:
- **79.96% test accuracy** (vs expected 83.57%)
- **82.85% validation accuracy**
- **Proper learning progression** (52% → 80%+)

## Files Modified
1. `configs.py` - Updated learning_rate and weight_decay
2. `configs.json` - Updated batch_size, patience, shuffle
3. `src/process/balanced_training_config.py` - Removed residual connections
4. `src/process/step.py` - Disabled gradient clipping

## Expected Results
With these fixes, `python main.py -p` should now:
- Start learning immediately (not stuck at 50%)
- Reach 70%+ validation accuracy by epoch 20
- Achieve 80%+ test accuracy
- Complete training in ~60-80 epochs with early stopping

## Verification
Run: `python main.py -p` and expect to see:
```
Epoch 0: Train ~52%, Val ~53%
Epoch 20: Train ~84%, Val ~73%
Epoch 60: Train ~92%, Val ~82%
Final: Test ~80%+
