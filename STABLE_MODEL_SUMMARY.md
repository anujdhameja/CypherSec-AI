# Stable Model Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented

### 1. **StableDevignModel** (in `src/process/devign.py`)
- **Reduced GNN steps**: 8 → 4 to prevent gradient explosion
- **Batch normalization**: Added after every layer for stability
- **Residual connections**: Helps gradient flow
- **Simplified architecture**: Removed Conv1d layers that caused instability

### 2. **Enhanced Training Loop** (in `src/process/step.py`)
- **Gradient clipping**: max_norm=1.0 to prevent exploding gradients
- **NaN loss detection**: Skips batches with NaN loss
- **Gradient monitoring**: Warns when gradient norm > 10
- **Proper target formatting**: Ensures correct tensor shapes

### 3. **Learning Rate Scheduler** (in `src/process/modeling.py`)
- **ReduceLROnPlateau**: Reduces LR when validation loss plateaus
- **Automatic stepping**: Integrated into training loop

### 4. **Updated Configuration** (in `configs.json`)
- **Learning rate**: 1e-4 → 3e-4 (increased for stability)
- **GNN layers**: 6 → 4 (reduced for stability)
- **Loss lambda**: 1.3e-6 → 0.0 (disabled complex loss)
- **Epochs**: 100 → 50 (faster iteration)

## 🔧 Key Stability Fixes

| Issue | Solution | Impact |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Gradient explosion | Gradient clipping (1.0) | Prevents training crashes |
| Vanishing gradients | Batch normalization + residuals | Better gradient flow |
| Complex loss function | Simple CrossEntropy | More stable training |
| Too many GNN steps | 8 → 4 steps | Reduces gradient accumulation |
| Low learning rate | 1e-4 → 3e-4 | Faster convergence |

## 📊 Expected Performance

### Training Progression:
- **Epoch 1-5**: Train ~40-50%, Val ~40-45%
- **Epoch 10-20**: Train ~55-65%, Val ~50-55%
- **Epoch 30+**: Train ~60-70%, Val ~52-58%

### What to Watch For:
- ✅ Loss should decrease smoothly (no huge jumps)
- ✅ Train accuracy should be >= Val accuracy
- ✅ Gradient norms should stay < 10
- ✅ No NaN losses

## 🚀 How to Use

### Run Training:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Monitor Training:
- Watch for gradient norm warnings
- Check for smooth loss curves
- Expect accuracy to improve gradually

## 🔍 Architecture Comparison

### Before (Unstable):
```
Input(205) → GNN(8 steps) → Conv1d → Conv1d → Classifier
- Complex loss function
- No gradient clipping
- No batch normalization
- High gradient explosion risk
```

### After (Stable):
```
Input(205) → BatchNorm → GNN(4 steps) → BatchNorm → Classifier
- Simple CrossEntropy loss
- Gradient clipping (1.0)
- Batch normalization
- Residual connections
- Learning rate scheduler
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Run training**: `python main.py`
2. **Monitor progress**: Watch for smooth loss curves
3. **Adjust if needed**: If still unstable, reduce learning rate to 1e-4
4. **Compare results**: Should see much more stable training than before

The model is now ready for stable training with significantly reduced risk of gradient explosions and better convergence properties!
