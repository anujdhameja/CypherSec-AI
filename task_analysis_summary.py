print("\n1. üìä STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS:")
print("   ‚úÖ Dataset has reasonable size (959 samples from 5 files)")
print("   ‚úÖ Balanced classes (45% safe vs 55% vulnerable)")
print("   ‚ùå MINIMAL structural differences between vulnerable/safe:")
print("      - Vulnerable: 70.26 nodes avg, Safe: 65.76 nodes avg (only 4.5 difference)")
print("      - Feature means are IDENTICAL: -0.02 for both classes")
print("      - Feature std is IDENTICAL: 0.21 for both classes")

print("   ‚ùå 55.2% misclassification rate")
print("   ‚ùå 83 False Negatives vs 23 False Positives")

print("\n3. üî¨ GRAPH STRUCTURE ANALYSIS:")
print("   ‚ùå Most graphs are nearly LINEAR (avg degree ~1.0)")
print("   ‚ùå Many isolated nodes (50+ per graph)")
print("   ‚ùå Graphs look like TREES, not complex code structures")
print("   ‚ùå No clear structural patterns distinguishing vulnerable code")

print("   - 40% of graphs have all-zero or identical features")

print("   - Model literally has NO INFORMATION for 40% of data")

print("\n2. INADEQUATE GRAPH REPRESENTATION:")

print("\n1. FIX FEATURE EXTRACTION PIPELINE:")
print("   - Investigate why 40% of graphs have zero features")
print("   - Check Word2Vec training and vocabulary")
print("   - Verify node content extraction from CPG")
print("   - Add debugging to feature extraction process")

print("\n2. IMPROVE GRAPH REPRESENTATION:")
print("   - Add more edge types (control flow, data flow)")
print("   - Include function call relationships")
print("   - Add semantic node types (variable, function, operator)")
print("   - Capture more complex code patterns")

print("\n3. ENHANCE FEATURES:")
print("   - Add domain-specific features (API calls, patterns)")
print("   - Include code metrics (complexity, depth)")
print("   - Add security-specific patterns")
print("   - Use better embeddings (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT)")

print("\n4. VALIDATE LABELS:")
print("   - Manual inspection of 'obvious' vulnerable samples")
print("   - Check inter-annotator agreement")
print("   - Verify labeling methodology")

print("   - Graph structure: Higher average degree (2-4)")

print("\n1. DEBUG FEATURE EXTRACTION:")
print("   - Run feature extraction on single file")
print("   - Check Word2Vec vocabulary and embeddings")
print("   - Verify CPG node content extraction")

print("\n2. MANUAL SAMPLE INSPECTION:")
print("   - Look at actual source code for misclassified samples")
print("   - Check if vulnerabilities are obvious to humans")
print("   - Validate that labels make sense")

print("\n3. BASELINE COMPARISON:")
print("   - Try simple static analysis rules")
