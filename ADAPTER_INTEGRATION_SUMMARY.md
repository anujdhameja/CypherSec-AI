# Adapter Integration Summary

## ✅ Successfully Integrated

The `adapter.py` file has been successfully updated to work with your Devign project structure.

### 🔧 **Key Integrations:**

1. **Data Loading**: 
   - Uses your actual pickle files from `data/input/`
   - Implements proper train/val/test splitting with stratification
   - Handles PyTorch Geometric Data objects correctly
   - Loads 952 samples from 5 files for testing

2. **Model Creation**:
   - Uses your `BalancedDevignModel` from the stable implementation
   - Correctly sets input dimension to 100 (based on data diagnostic)
   - Integrates with your Devign class structure
   - Handles device placement (CPU/GPU)

3. **Data Structure**:
   - Batch shape: `torch.Size([384, 100])` (multiple graphs batched)
   - Target shape: `torch.Size([8])` (batch size 8)
   - Class weights calculated: `[1.0812, 0.9302]` (slightly imbalanced)

### 📊 **Test Results:**
- ✅ Train batches: 84
- ✅ Val batches: 18  
- ✅ Test batches: 18
- ✅ Model creation successful
- ✅ Class weights calculated
- ✅ Batch structure validated

### 🚀 **Ready for Hyperparameter Search:**

The adapter now properly bridges your Devign project with hyperparameter optimization tools. You can run:

```bash
python auto_hyperparameter_comprehensive.py
```

### 🔍 **What the Adapter Does:**

1. **Loads your data** using the fallback method (pickle files)
2. **Creates your model** using BalancedDevignModel
3. **Handles batching** with PyTorch Geometric DataLoader
4. **Calculates class weights** for balanced training
5. **Extracts targets** from PyTorch Geometric Data objects

### ⚙️ **Configuration Used:**
- Input dimension: 100 (from data diagnostic)
- Hidden dimension: 200
- GNN steps: 4 (stable configuration)
- Dropout: 0.2 (reduced regularization)
- Batch size: 8

The adapter successfully integrates with your existing codebase and is ready for automated hyperparameter optimization!
